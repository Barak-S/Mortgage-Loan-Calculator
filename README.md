Loans are saved using a node.js server and a MongoDB database. All saved loans can be viewed in the “All Loans” tab in the nav bar. From here, users can click on a loan to be taken to the loan show page where a Google Maps API is integrated for a dynamic map and street view of the loan address. Users can also edit and update loan details.
